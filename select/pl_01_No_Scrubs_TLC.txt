A scrub is a guy that thinks
hes fine and is
also known as a buster
Always thinkin' about
what he wants
He just sits on his
(oh his, on his, on his)
So...(no)
I don't want your
number (no)
I don't wanna give you
mine and (no)
I don't wanna meet you
no where (no)
I don't want none
of your time and (no)
I don't want no scrub

can't get no love from me
Hanging out the passenger side
Of his best friends ride
Trying to hollar at me
I don't want no scrub

can't get no love from me
Hanging out the passenger side
Of his best friends ride

And a scrubs is checkin' me
But his game is kinda weak
And I know he
can't approach me
Cause I"m looking like class and
